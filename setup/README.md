## Prerequisites

Ensure that you already have a Minecraft Account and the Default Minecraft Launcher installed. If you donâ€™t you can get them here:
- A Minecraft Account: https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/store/minecraft-deluxe-collection-pc

*Ensure that you are getting Minecraft **JAVA** Edition - this is very important!*

## Installing Fabric
1. Download the Fabric Installer from https://fabricmc.net/use/installer/
 * Note for Linux: *Download universal installer (jar file), go to directory where fabric jar file was downloaded to, and run `java -jar fabric-installer.jar` (or whatever the installer file name is)*
        
2. Run the installer. Select the following settings:
 * **Client**, NOT Server.
 * Minecraft Version: **1.20.1**
 * Loader Version: **0.16.10**

 * Then, click **Install**.

## Getting the files
1. Download all of the mods inside of the `mods` folder. There should be 12 of them.
2. Download the resourcepack inside of the `resourcepacks` folder. Do not unzip it.
*Note, all credit goes to [Mattbatwings](https://www.youtube.com/@mattbatwings) for the resourcepack!*

## Mods and Resourcepack Setup
*Note, if you are familiar with setting up mods/resourcepacks and/or have your own file organization you may skip this section.*
1. Open the Minecraft Launcher.
2. Click on the "Installations" tab near the top.
3. You should see fabric-loader-1.20.1 as one of the installations. Click on the triple dots, and click "Edit".

4. You want to change the "Game Directory". Click "BROWSE", and it should open up your `\.minecraft` folder. I would create a new folder inside of `\.minecraft` called `Fabric 1.20.1`. Select that folder to be your Game Directory. Then, click "Save".

5. Now, back to the "Installations" menu, click on "Open installations folder" to open the `Fabric 1.20.1` folder you've created.

6. Create two new folders inside of here called `mods` and `resourcepacks`. Now, move the mods you've downloaded into the `mods` folder, and the resourcepack into the `resourcepacks` folder. Your `mods` folder should look like:

    Your `resourcepacks` folder should look like:

We will exclusively be using this resourcepack in class due to its sleek design and many utilities (showing redstone signal strength, clean wool/lamp design, etc.)

## Optimizations/Commands

Most of the mods we had you install were quality of life or performance enhancing mods. However, two of them: **Carpet mod** and **Worldedit** will be quite useful for your projects.

**Carpet mod** essentially allows you to take complete control over how your game runs. Some useful commands are the following:
 * `/carpet setDefault creativeNoClip true` allows you to fly through blocks, which is SUPER useful for building large, complex redstone circuits. **I would enter this command in immediately upon creating a new world.**
 * `/tick rate [number]` allows you to change the tick rate/speed at which your game runs. Useful for testing circuits that take awhile to run.
 * `/tick freeze` and `/tick step [number]` are useful for debugging your redstone circuits (yes, we even have a debugger in MINECRAFT). 
 * `/carpet creativeFlySpeed [number]` allows you to adjust your creative flight speed
 
 **Worldedit** allows you to build a LOT faster and saves a lot of pain (from experience). Some useful commands are:

 * `//wand` gives you a wand for area selection with left and right click
 * `//copy` copies the area, relative to your position
 * `//paste` pastes whatever is in your clipboard
 * `//set [block]` fills the area with `block`. If `[block]` is `air`, then it removes all blocks in the area
 * `//move [number] [direction]` moves the area you selected `[number]` blocks in `[direction]` direction. `[direction]` can be `up, down, back, left, right, forward`.
 * `//stack [number] [direction]` stacks the area you selected relative to the direction you are facing. `[direction]` can be `up, down, back, left, right, forward` for as many `[number]` times as you want. This is **SUPER** useful - I absolutely crutch this command
 * `//undo` and `//redo` are self-explaining.
 * Other useful commands: `//flip` flips your clipboard based on the direction faced and `//rotate` rotates the content of your clipboard

I would get super familiar with using these commands, as they might be useful to you in your projects! :)
